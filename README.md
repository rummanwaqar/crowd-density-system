# Crowd Density Estimation System

Almost everyone has a mobile phone with them these days. 
What if we could use these devices to estimate the number of people in a certain area? 
This could allow businesses and city planners to make data-driven decisions.

Our simple API allows businesses to monitor flow of customers.

We build realtime density maps of the environment to allow better analysis of traffic flow.
